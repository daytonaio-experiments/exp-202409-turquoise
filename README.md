### Dev Environment Recipe for Data Science with Alternative Copilot Extension using Local LLM via Ollama API

**Job to be Done:**

**When** data scientists need to set up a secure and efficient development environment for data science projects,

**We want to** create a streamlined environment setup recipe that includes an alternative Copilot extension running via a local Large Language Model (LLM) with the Ollama API.

**So that** data scientists can work in secure, high-performance environments while ensuring data locality and privacy, reducing reliance on external cloud-based services.

### Objectives

1. **Environment Setup Recipe:** Provide a comprehensive environment setup recipe specifically tailored for data science projects.
2. **Alternative Copilot Extension:** Develop or integrate an alternative Copilot extension that utilizes a local LLM for code assistance.
3. **Local LLM Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with the Ollama API to run the local LLM for enhanced security and data privacy.
4. **Data Locality and Security:** Emphasize data locality and security throughout the environment setup process.

### High-Level Functional Specification for Dev Environment Recipe for Data Science with Alternative Copilot Extension

#### Overview
This document outlines the functional specification for the "Dev Environment Recipe for Data Science with Alternative Copilot Extension," a feature in the Daytona project designed to provide data scientists with a secure and efficient development environment.
